### Slash Commands

You can also use commands like `/balance`, `/work`, and `/daily` to perform actions. This modern interaction method enhances user experience.

## Commands

Here are some of the primary commands available in the Economy Bot:

- `!balance` or `/balance`: Check your current balance.
- `!work` or `/work`: Earn some virtual currency by completing a task.
- `!daily` or `/daily`: Claim your daily reward.
- `!shop` or `/shop`: View available items for purchase.
- `!buy <item>` or `/buy <item>`: Purchase an item from the shop.
- `!trade <user>` or `/trade <user>`: Trade currency with another user.

### Example Usage
